## 🤓 What I learned
- Official document is the best source of information!
- **Lifting state up** to manage shared data and synchronise state between child components.
- **Immutability is important** for optimising performance by skipping unnecessary re-renders and managing reusable data. (undo, redo and time travel) 
- The **key** is used to determine which components to update. Assign propper keys whenever you build dynamic lists.
- Avoid redundant state; check if it can be calculated from existing data.
